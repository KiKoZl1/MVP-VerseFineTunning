title: 29. Modules & Imports in Verse (Revised) — using Blocks and Facade Pattern
tags: [verse, modules, imports, using, scope, facade]
summary: Revised guidance for import layout with a facade to isolate engine calls; examples stay minimal and readable.

# Modules & Imports (`using`) — Revised

Keep imports at the **top** and minimize them. Where engine APIs are noisy, route calls through a small **facade** with clear names and logs.

---

## 1) Import Block (Top of File)

```verse
using { /Verse.org }
using {/Verse.org/Simulation }
using {/Fortnite.com/Playspace }
using {/Fortnite.com/Characters }
```

- One compact line; only import what’s needed in this file.

---

## 2) Facade Around Engine Calls

```verse
DamageFacade(Amount : float) : void =
    if (P : player = GetPlayspace().GetPlayers()[0]):
        if (Char : fort_character = P.GetFortCharacter[]):
            Char.Damage(Amount)
            Print("[Facade] damage amount={Amount}")
```

- Keeps call sites clean and avoids scattering engine specifics.

---

## 3) File Layout Template

1. `using { ... }`
2. `@editable` tunables / constants
3. Facade(s) for engine calls
4. Private helpers (pure functions)
5. `OnBegin<override>()` orchestration

---

## 4) Minimal Example

```verse
using { /Verse.org }
using {/Verse.org/Simulation }
using {/Fortnite.com/Playspace }
using {/Fortnite.com/Characters }

@editable
DefaultDamage : float = 12.5

OnBegin<override>() : void =
    DamageFacade(DefaultDamage)
```

- Demonstrates imports, a tunable, a facade, and a tiny event.

---

## 5) Finetuning Notes (LLM)

- Keep the `using` block stable and always on top.
- Prefer one **facade** per narrow engine interaction.
- Keep orchestration short and logs concise.
