# Expressions & Types in Verse

This page unifies the essentials: **literals**, **operators**, and **types** you’ll see in everyday Verse code, plus patterns that make intent and safety obvious.

---

## 1) Core Types at a Glance

- **int** — whole numbers (scores, counts).
- **float** — decimal numbers (damage amounts, seconds).
- **string** — text (names, messages).
- **logic** — boolean truth values.

> Prefer explicit names that include units, like `SleepSeconds`, `DamageAmount`.

---

## 2) Literals & Simple Bindings

```verse
Score       : int    = 0
DamageAmount: float  = 20.0
PlayerName  : string = "Player1"
IsAlive?    : logic  = true
```

- Bind with `:=` for locals; use `: type = value` for file-level clarity.

---

## 3) Operators (Arithmetic & Comparison)

```verse
A := 2 + 3 * 4        # arithmetic
B := 10.0 / 2.5       # floats
IsHighScore? : logic = Score >= 100

# comparisons are failable in failure contexts
if (Score = 200):
    Print("Exactly 200")
```

- Keep arithmetic readable; avoid dense one-liners when teaching a model.
- Comparisons used inside `if` act as **failable** checks (see Failure & Control Flow).

---

## 4) Strings & Interpolation

```verse
Name := "Kiko"
Print("Hello, {Name}")
```

- Prefer interpolation for logs to keep examples concise and consistent.

---

## 5) Truthiness & Failure

- Use **explicit** logic values (`true`/`false`).  
- Chain checks inside `if` blocks and keep **effects last** in the block.

```verse
if (IsAlive?):
    Print("Player is alive")
```

---

## 6) Practical Patterns

- Use **constants** for design values; pass them to helpers as parameters.
- Compute derived values in locals, then perform effects.

```verse
ApplyScaledDamage(Base : float, Scale : float) : void =
    Amount := Base * Scale
    HurtFirstPlayer(Amount)
```

---

## 7) Common Pitfalls

- **Mixed responsibilities** in one expression — split into named locals.
- **Magic numbers** without names — extract to a constant.
- **Unclear types** — annotate file-level bindings for readability.

---

## 8) Finetuning Notes (LLM)

- Pair each operator with a tiny, single-purpose example.
- Prefer explicit names and units to teach intent.
- Keep success/failure cases near each other to learn contrast.
