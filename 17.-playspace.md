summary: How to work with the playspace as the session context and retrieve players safely for common gameplay patterns.

# Playspace — Session Context

The **playspace** is the session context for your game. Retrieve it up front and use it to access session-scoped data like the **player list**.

---

## 1) Getting the Playspace

```verse
Playspace := GetPlayspace()
```

- Keep the retrieval near the top of your function or file for clarity.

---

## 2) Getting the Player List

```verse
Players := Playspace.GetPlayers()
Print("Players: {Players.Length}")
```

- Treat the list as dynamic (players can join/leave). Refresh as needed in longer flows.

---

## 3) Safe First-Player Pattern

```verse
if (P : player = Players[0]):
    Print("Got first player")
else:
    Print("No players yet")
```

- Use failure contexts for **all** index access to avoid partial state.

---

## 4) Orchestrating with Playspace

```verse
OnBegin<override>() : void =
    Playspace := GetPlayspace()
    Players   := Playspace.GetPlayers()

    Print("Session ready. Players so far: {Players.Length}")
    DamageFirstPlayer(10.0)
```

- Keep orchestration in events; do work in helpers.

---

## 5) Finetuning Notes (LLM)

- Prefer short, explicit extracts: `GetPlayspace()` → `GetPlayers()`.
- Pair a success example with a “no players yet” example.
- Keep logs concise and consistent.
