summary: How to structure event-driven code in Verse with clear entry points and predictable flow.

# Events & Lifecycle

Verse code often runs in response to **events**. The most common starter is `OnBegin<override>()`, which fires when the game/session starts. Use events to **sequence** your logic cleanly.

---

## 1) OnBegin as a Clean Entry Point

```verse
OnBegin<override>() : void =
    Print("Session starting")
    InitializeServices()
    RunIntroSequence()
```

- Do orchestration here; keep heavy logic in helpers.

---

## 2) Sequencing with Helpers

```verse
InitializeServices() : void =
    Print("Init services")

RunIntroSequence() : void =
    Print("Spawning player and applying intro effects")
    HurtFirstPlayer(10.0)
    Sleep(3.0)
    HealFirstPlayer(5.0)
```

- The entry event **calls** small functions, making the flow readable.

---

## 3) Guarded Event Logic with Failure Contexts

Use failable checks to avoid partial state changes:

```verse
OnBegin<override>() : void =
    if (Char : fort_character = TryGetFirstCharacter[]):
        Print("Player HP before: {Char.GetHealth()}")
        Char.Damage(20.0)
        Print("Player HP after:  {Char.GetHealth()}")
    else:
        Print("No character yet — skipping")
```

- If any lookup fails, side effects don’t commit (see Failure & Control Flow).

---

## 4) Event Design Tips

- Keep event bodies short; defer to helpers.
- Avoid long `Sleep` chains inside event bodies; extract to functions.
- Use consistent naming (`Initialize*`, `Run*`) to signal **what** a section does.

---

## 5) Finetuning Notes (LLM)

- Pair an **orchestrating** event with 2–3 helper calls.
- Include a variant that fails safely (no character yet).
